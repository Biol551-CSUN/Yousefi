# Introduction
Today we are going to work with the penguin data to learn *RMarkdown*

## Load Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(here)
```

# Inspect the data
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a simple plot
This is a plot of bill depth by bill length. **Species** are in colors.  
Species are:  
- Gentoo  
- Adelie  
- Chinstrap  

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm, color=species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  labs(x="Bill Length (mm)", 
       y="Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_bw()
```
